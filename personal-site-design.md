 What is you site's primary purpose?
 Initially, I'm using it as a test site to apply what I'm learning about web development. However I hope it can become an introduction and portfolio site to introduce me to people I may be working with or for in the future.

 Who is your target audience?
 Members of my cohort and EDA staff, potential employers, others I may be working with on projects in the future.
 
 How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
 I'd like them to have a good sense of my professional self and my abilities and interests. I'd like them to find the information they want quickly and easily without being overwhelmed.
 
 What will you do to make your page accessible?
 - Ensure I use appropriately contrasting colours
 - Ensure all images have descriptions, and that content other than text and images are percievable using more than one sense.
 - Ensure it doesn't require an overly high level of motor skills to navigate
 - Ensure good semantic structure.
 
 How will you make your page usable?
 Along with implementing the accessibility standards outlined above, I will make sure it is easily navigatable using the principles people have come to expect to be applied to websites (eg the main navigation is a bar along the top or a column to the left, not a triangle in the bottom right corner), is responsive and therefore able to be used across a wide range of devices, does not contain broken links or other errors and does not load overly slowly.
